Decision making is a critical task that spans not just science and industry but
arguably the entire human experience.  At the same time, decision making in
complex circumstances is notoriously subtle and counterintuitive.  How do we
make principled decisions between a set of actions, $A$?  If we could quantify
our _utility_ for each action,
$$ 
\begin{alignat*}{6}
U :\; &A& &\rightarrow& \; &\mathbb{R}^{+}&
\\
&a& &\mapsto& &U(x)&,
\end{alignat*}
$$
then we could simply select the action with the highest utility, 
$$
a^{*} = \underset{a \in A}{\text{argmax}} U(a).
$$
In practice, however, even the most rigorous utility assignments will depend on 
circumstances we do not know with perfect certainty and we must rely on 
_inferences_ to inform those circumstances and motivate effective decision 
making.

Bayesian inferences utilizes probability theory to quantify information about 
statistical models derived from both domain expertise and observed data, which 
in turn naturally advises principled decision making.  In this case study we'll
review the foundations of statistical models and Bayesian inference relevant 
for practical applications.  In the appendix I'll also present a short 
introduction to frequentist inference with comparisons to the Bayesian paradigm.

I take an observational perspective here that presumes the existence of a true
data generating process that generates the observations from which we learn.
That perspective is not universal and clashes with some philosophical 
perspectives on Bayesian inference, and indeed statistics in general, that are 
not uncommon in popular introductory texts.  Fortunately in most cases the 
differences between these perspectives don't have any consequences for how the 
resulting methodology is implemented in practice, but it helps to keep in mind
the different perspectives when comparing this material to other literature.

# Probabilistic Modeling

Models are approximations of the complex dynamics that drive the observable 
phenomena in the world around us.  They provide the setting in which we can
formalize learning and decision making and hence are a foundational aspect to
any rigorous analysis.  In this section we review latent observational 
processes, the data generating processes they incite, and the probabilistic 
models that attempt to capture the relevant structure of those data generating 
processes.

## The Observational Process

A typical abstraction in applied analysis is to assume that we are making
decisions about how to interact with some latent _phenomenon_.  Consequently
our inferential target is the phenomenon itself.  

No material phenomenon, however, exists in isolation.  Any phenomenon relevant 
to statistical inquiry must manifests within some latent system that includes,
at the very least, the mechanisms with which we can interact with it.  In other 
words we can observe the phenomenon of interest only through its surrounding 
_environment_.

<center>

<br>
```{r, out.width = "75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/inferential_config/observational_process/environment/environment.png")
```
<br><br>

</center>

Consequently in order to make the desired inferences we need an observational 
_probe_ that explores the environment and, hopefully, the phenomenon of 
interest.  

<center>

<br>
```{r, out.width = "75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/inferential_config/observational_process/probe/probe.png")
```
<br><br>

</center>

The interaction of the probe with the environment and the phenomenon defines an 
_observational process_ which examines the latent system and induces explicit 
observations that are sensitive to the phenomenon of interest. 

<center>

<br>
```{r, out.width = "75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/inferential_config/observational_process/observational_process/observational_process.png")
```
<br><br>

</center>

An observational process encompasses any methodology that measures, collects, 
curates, or manipulates observations sensitive to the latent phenomenon.  This 
includes, for example, both dedicated experiments explicitly designed to 
interrogate the phenomenon of interest as well as retrospective analyses of 
incidental experiments or previously conducted experiments designed for other 
purposes.

In encapsulating the phenomenon of interest our probe intersects only part of 
the surrounding environment.  Consequently the observational process will
be sensitive to only those elements of the environment relevant to the probe.
Often well-designed experiments can better isolate the target phenomenon,
yielding much cleaner observational processes and more informative observations.

There are typically many ways to interrogate an environment and the phenomena
it exhibits, and hence many possible probes.
<center>

<br>
```{r, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/inferential_config/observational_process/multiple_probes/multiple_probes.png")
```
<br><br>

</center>

Each of these probes defines its own observational process, each of which can 
become the basis of independent analyses or components in a more sophisticated
analyses.

<center>

<br>
```{r, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/inferential_config/observational_process/multiple_observational_processes/multiple_observational_processes.png")
```
<br><br>

</center>

Consequently observational processes are bespoke to not only a given phenomenon 
but also the specific details of the probe used to investigate it.

## The True Data Generating Process

Fundamentally what makes inference so subtle is that the realizations of an 
observational process are not constant but rather can take on a variety of
values.  Formally we define the space of possible values of observational
outcomes as the _observation space_, $Y$.

In particular, the realized observations, for example, may exhibit _aleatoric_ 
variation due to _ontological_ stochasticity inherent to the latent phenomenon, 
its environment, or the probe used to interrogate them.  For example the atomic
decays that give rise to radiation occur in random directions and at random
intervals, theoretically due to their quantum mechanical nature.

At the same time the realized observations may exhibit _epistemological_ 
uncertainty due to limitations in how accurately we can observe the latent 
system.  Lengths of an object reported using a ruler, for example, are limited 
by the precision of the markings and the resolution of the human eye; they 
will not in general be consistent from person to person or even a single person
from time to time.  Similarly, the increasingly common digital means of 
collecting and processing data are limited by the numerical precision of the
intermediate computations.

Ultimately we can't discriminate between the nature of these behaviors.  For 
example one can always argue that seemingly ontological variation is a result of 
the imprecise observation of complex but deterministic dynamics, such as those
arising in chaos theory.  Fortunately the exact philosophical nature of this 
behavior isn't relevant in practice because these different perspectives all
manifest in the _same_ mathematical assumptions.

Regardless of its interpretation we presume that this behavior is sufficiently 
regular that, while it cannot be quantified with any single observation, it can 
be quantified with a _distribution_ of observations.  More formally we embody 
the  observational process with a probability distribution over the observation 
space, with realizations of the observation process becoming samples from that 
distribution.  

Probability distributions over the observation space are in general denoted
_data generating processes_, and the probability distribution that captures the
observational process in a given application is denoted the _true data 
generating process_, $\pi^{\dagger}$.  

<center>

<br>
```{r, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/inferential_config/dgp/dgp3/dgp3.png")
```
<br><br>

</center>

In order to distinguish points in the observation space from explicitly realized 
observations I will decorate the latter with a tilde.  Hence $y$ denotes a point
in the observation space while $\tilde{y}$ denotes a realized observation.

<center>

<br>
```{r, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/inferential_config/dgp/dgp4/dgp4.png")
```
<br><br>

</center>

In any given application the true data generating process is unknown and,
practically, unknowable.  Inference is tasked with understanding the true data 
generating process as well as possible using a given observation as its only 
expression.  In particular, inference hopefully advices decisions about how to 
interact with the latent phenomenon encompassed within the true data generating
process.

<center>

<br>
```{r, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/inferential_config/dgp/dgp6/dgp6.png")
```
<br><br>

</center>

Knowledge of true data generating process would, however, provide the necessary
context for calibrating decision making processes informed by observations. 
Consider formalizing a decision making process as map from the observation
space to the action space,
$$ 
\begin{alignat*}{6}
a :\; &Y& &\rightarrow& \; &A&
\\
&y& &\mapsto& &a(y)&.
\end{alignat*}
$$
Given knowledge of the latent system we could hypothetically construct a 
utility function for each possible action, $U : A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$, 
which would then quantify the benefit of the decision making process in light 
of a given observation as
$$ 
\begin{alignat*}{6}
U \circ a :\; &Y& &\rightarrow& \; &\mathbb{R}^{+}&
\\
&y& &\mapsto& &U(a(y))&.
\end{alignat*}
$$
We could then establish the distribution of outcomes by pushing forward the
true data generating process through this composite function.

Unfortunately this calibration is purely hypothetical.  In any realistic 
application we will not understand the the latent system well enough to 
construct an exact utility function nor the the true data generating process
to quantify the distribution of possible utilities.

## The Observational Model

At this point we have presumed the existence of a true data generating process,
but we don't know what form it will take in any given application.  In order to
find the appropriate data generating process we would ideally search through the
space of _all_ data generating processes, that is the collection of all 
probability distributions over the observation space, $\mathcal{P}$.

Unfortunately this _big world_ of data generating processes is just too large
and complex to be able to quantify in any practical application.  Indeed the 
depths of this space are where mathematicians lurk, and that alone should be 
reason enough to stay away.  "Some of my best friends are mathematicians" the
author says in vain as everyone leaves the room...

In any case, we have to limit our search to something more tractable in 
practical applications.  That is we have to consider only a _small world_, 
$\mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{P}$, of data generating processes that is more
manageable.  This small world defines an _observational model_ consisting of 
individual data generating process that each define a possible mathematical 
narrative of how the data could be generated.

<center>

<br>
```{r, out.width = "75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/small_world/small_world/small_world.png")
```
<br><br>

</center>

In practice it helps to have a way to label the data generating processes within
an observational model.  Consequently we will parameterize the small world by
assigning each data generating process a unique value, $\theta \in \Theta$.  I 
will refer to each parameter, $\theta$, as a _model configuration_ and the 
parameter space, $\Theta, as the _model configuration space_.  Given a 
parameterization we can then specify the observational model with family of 
probability density functions, $\pi_{\mathcal{S}} (y ; \theta)$.  Keep in mind
that parameterizations are not unique; in general there will be many equivalent 
ways of labeling the data generating processes within an observational model.

Once we limit out perspective to a given observational model, our inferential 
goal becomes the quantification of those model configurations that are similar 
to the true data generating process, and hence useful for informing our ultimate 
decisions.  If the observational model contains the true data generating process 
then basing our inferences on the observational model incurs no losses; an 
exhaustive search through the small world will always make it to the true data 
generating process.  

We need not be so fortunate, however, and the true data generating process might 
lie outside the scope of the observational model.

<center>

<br>
```{r, out.width = "75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/small_world/small_world_one/small_world_one.png")
```
<br><br>

</center>

Indeed in practice this circumstance is the rule rather than the exception.
In applications observational models are limited by the constraints of 
mathematical and computational feasibility and will be unable to fully capture
the, frankly ridiculous, complexity of the natural world.

The inferences generated from an observational model that doesn't contain the
true data generating process may still be meaningful so long as the data 
generating processes it does contain captures the structure of the true data 
generating process that we can resolve in our observations.  For example, an 
ecological model that neglects quantum mechanics and general relativity is too 
meager to capture the _entirety_ of any observation of animal migration.  Most 
ecological research, however, is sufficiently useful without having to consider 
what might happen if birds started migrating at the speed of light or quantum 
tunneling through geographical impediments.  At the same time, research 
considering bird navigation by following magnetic fields with physiological 
observations might need a more sophisticated consideration of quantum mechanics.

Ultimately the observational model is an _approximation_ to the true data 
generating process, a realization that resonates with the famous quote of
George Box that "all models are wrong but some are useful".  Some use that quote 
to motivate carelessness with the observational model, but Box was arguing the
opposite.  Only with respect for the given application and careful work can we 
develop an observational model that sufficiently well-approximates the true data 
generating process and provides the foundation for useful inferences.

Consideration of the observational process that gives rise to the true data
generating process is critical to principled model development, but we always
have to be careful to recognize the limitations of the observational model in 
any given analysis.

### The Generative Structure of an Observational Model

The richer the observational model, the more each model configuration will 
emulate the _generative_ structure of the observational process, from the 
latent phenomenon through the surrounding environment to the final observational
probe.  Reasoning about the structure of this generative process is particularly
effective in the design of useful observational models.  

In particular, the parameters of a model following the generative structure of 
the observational process might then decompose into parameters for each layer,
$$
\theta = \{ \theta_{\text{phenom}}, 
\theta_{\text{envir}}, \theta_{\text{probe}} \}.
$$
Keep in mind that the separation between environmental and probe parameters, 
however, need not always be so clean, especially for more primitive 
approximations to the true data generating process.  For example is the 
influence of the person collecting the data better classified as a part of the 
environment or a part of the probe?  Taken together the non-phenomenological 
parameters are sometimes denoted _systematic_ parameters. 

In addition to facilitating the design of the observational model for a single 
probe, this generative decomposition also motivates principled observational
models for multiple probes.  For example two probes might interrogate the 
same phenomenon, but they won't experience exactly the same environment and 
probe circumstances.  Consequently we might specify the observational model as
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi_{\mathcal{S}} (y ; \theta)
=& \;\;\;
\pi_{\mathcal{S}} (y_{1} ; \theta_{\text{phenom}}, 
\theta_{\text{envir}}, \theta_{\text{envir}, 1}, 
\theta_{\text{probe}}, \theta_{\text{probe}, 1})
\\
& \cdot
\pi_{\mathcal{S}} (y_{2} ; \theta_{\text{phenom}}, 
\theta_{\text{envir}}, \theta_{\text{envir}, 2}, 
\theta_{\text{probe}}, \theta_{\text{probe}, 2}),
\end{align*}
$$
where the subscripted parameters, such as $\theta_{\text{envir}, 1}$ are unique 
to a specific context and the non-subscripted parameters, such as 
$\theta_{\text{envir}}$, are shared across contexts.  The better we can model 
the systematic structure of the observational process the better we can build 
analyses that study the same phenomenon across different experiments, or develop 
hypotheses about the outcomes of new experiments targeting the same phenomenon.

Consider, for example, a latent phenomenon that influences a binary response in 
the environment.  We might model this response with an unknown probability, $p$,
of the binary response taking the value $y = 1$ instead of $y = 0$.  The 
specifics of the observational model then depend on the structure of the
observational probe.  

If we probe the system once and record the binary outcome then we might utilize 
an observational model consisting of of Bernoulli distributions parameterized 
by the phenomenological probability,
$$
\pi_{\mathcal{S}} (y ; \theta = p) = \text{Ber} (y \mid p).
$$
Presuming that the system is memoryless then repeated probes might be modeled
as a product of independent Bernoulli distributions that are all parameterized 
by the same phenomenological probability,
$$
\pi_{\mathcal{S}} (y_{1}, \ldots, y_{N} ; \theta = p) = 
\prod_{n = 1}^{N} \text{Ber} (y_{n} \mid p).
$$
Alternatively we might repeatedly probe the system only to record the total 
number of $y = 1$ responses, $k$ in which case we could apply a model of 
binomial distributions parameterized with the phenomenological probability,
$$
\pi_{\mathcal{S}} (k; \theta = p) = \text{Bin} (k \mid p).
$$
Finally probing until $k$ unity responses are observed could be modeled with
negative Binomial distributions parameterized by the phenomenological
probability,
$$
\pi_{\mathcal{S}} (k; \theta) = \text{NegBin} (k \mid p).
$$

A simple binary response quantified by a phenomenological probability is, 
however, a relatively crude approximation to the more sophisticated latent 
structure.  The more deeply we look at the observational process the richer 
our observational model will have to become.  

That binary response, for example, might correspond to the capture of a 
particular species in an ecological experiment.  In that case the probability
of capture might not be a single, monolithic parameter but rather the outcome
of the population dynamics between the species of interest, the species on which
it preys, and the species which predate it.

It could also correspond to the alarm of a detector that has recorded enough 
incident radiation to pass a certain threshold.  Here the latent probability 
would be a consequence of the possible sources of radiation, including radiation 
from particular sources of interest as well as the irrelevant background sources 
that permeate the environment.  Depending on the precision required of the
desired inferences we might also have to model the detector response itself,
including calibration of the incident radiation flux and the electronic signals
which are ultimately integrated to trigger the detection.

Each deeper look into the observational process discerns more detail and a 
richer generative structure.

### Limitations of Observational Models

Regardless of how sophisticated our observational model might be it will 
always be an approximation to the complexity of the true data generating 
process.  We have to be ever mindful of the limitations of the observational 
model in the context of any particular analysis.  

For example, the observational model might approximate the true data generating 
process only within a certain regime of behaviors.  At the same time the 
approximations might accurately capture only some behaviors but not others.
A given observational model can express the large scale structure of the latent
system but make no attempt to incorporate the structure at smaller scales.
It might capture statistical relationships between phenomenological parameters 
but fail to accurately convey the physical dynamics or explicit causal structure 
of the phenomenon and its interaction with the environment.  

Consequently we have to be extremely careful to employ model-based inferences 
only within the regimes where the approximations are reasonable and sufficient
for the decisions that we want to inform.  In other words, we have to develop a 
model that's just sophisticated enough for the given application.

Another subtly with the approximate nature of the observational model is that
a given observational model might be a reasonable approximation for _many_
true data generating processes.  This is particularly common for observational
models that focus on capturing the _emergent_ behaviors of a complex 
observational process.  At sufficiently coarse scales much of the latent 
structure averages out and only the most coherent of the latent behaviors
survive.  All true data generating process with similar emergent behavior can
then be equally well-approximated by the same observational model.

Linear regression, for example, can be interpreted as a deterministic linear
relationship between observed variables convolved with Gaussian fluctuations.
This linear relationship itself can be considered as a leading-order 
approximation to rich phenomenological behavior with the Gaussian variation 
approximating the environmental and probe behaviors.  Any true data generating 
process with the same first-order phenomenological behavior and emergent 
environmental and probe behaviors will be reasonably approximated by the same 
linear regression model. 

At the same time that linear regression model will offer no discrimination 
between all of the true data generating processes it approximations.  
In order to interpret of an observational model we need to go beyond it and
consider also the unique context of the specific true data generating process.  
The art of designing a useful analysis is not just the choice of observational
model but also the establishment of the surrounding context that gives the
model configurations a meaningful interpretation.

### Model-Based Calibration

While we cannot perfectly calibrate a decision-making process without knowing 
the true data generating process, we can define a proxy calibration within the
context of a given observational model.  

Firstly we assume that for each model configuration we can define utilities for 
all available actions,
$$ 
\begin{alignat*}{6}
U:\; &A \times \Theta& &\rightarrow& \; &\mathbb{R}^{+}&
\\
&(a, \theta)& &\mapsto& &U(a, \theta)&.
\end{alignat*}
$$
Given a particular model configuration we can then compute the utility of an 
observation-informed decision-making process with the composition
$$ 
\begin{alignat*}{6}
U \circ a :\; &Y \times \Theta& &\rightarrow& \; &\mathbb{R}^{+}&
\\
&(y, \theta)& &\mapsto& &U(a(y), \theta)&.
\end{alignat*}
$$
Finally because each model configuration identifies a data generating process 
we can compute _expected utilities_ over the possible observations, 
$\bar{U}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{y;\theta}} [ U(a(y), \theta) ]$, 
for each model configuration.  Alternatively we could push each of the data 
generating processes through the composite utility function to give a full 
distribution of possible utilities for each model configuration.

How we might exploit these expected utilities or utility distributions in an
analysis will then depend on how we handle their dependence on the unknown model
configuration.  No matter how we end up employing these model-based utilities we 
have to be vigilant in recognizing they are only as good as the observational 
model itself.

# Bayesian Inference

Once an observational model has been established, and its limitations 
acknowledged, we can consider _model-based inferences_ that identify which model 
configurations are most consistent with the true data generating process. 
Unfortunately without knowing the true data generating process these inferences
can be informed only by the information inherent in observed data and our own
domain expertise.

Consequently the observational model both plays two critical roles. Firstly
it defines a context for constructing inferences from observations.

<center>

<br>
```{r, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/inferential_config/model_config/model_config3/model_config3.png")
```
<br><br>

</center>

In particular, model-based inferences take the form of a quantification of which 
model configurations are consistent with the observed data. 

<center>

<br>
```{r, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/inferential_config/model_config/model_config4/model_config4.png")
```
<br><br>

</center>

Secondly those model-based inferences then inform decisions about how to 
interact with the latent phenomenon, bridging the gap between the observed
data and the latent system.

<center>

<br>
```{r, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/inferential_config/model_config/model_config5/model_config5.png")
```
<br><br>

</center>

The utility of those decisions will of course depend on how well the 
observational model approximates the relevant properties of the true data 
generating process.

Bayesian inference uses probability theory to quantify inferences within a 
model configuration; neighborhoods of model configurations that are more 
consistent are allocated probability.  We don't, however, choose a probability
distribution arbitrarily -- there is a natural procedure for updating a _prior 
distribution_ that encodes our domain expertise about the model into a
_posterior distribution_ that identifies those model configuration consistent 
with both our domain expertise _and_ the observed data.  Inferences, decisions, 
and predictions all follow from natural probabilistic operations.

## The Bayesian Model

Once we accept the use of probabilities to quantify inferences within the
small world, the observational model becomes more than just a collection of
data generating processes -- it becomes a conditional probability distribution
over the product of the observational space and model configuration space, 
$Y \times \Theta$,
$$
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y ; \theta) \rightarrow \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y \mid \theta).
$$

A _prior model_ is defined by a marginal distribution over the model 
configuration space, $\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta)$, that encodes domain expertise 
about the observational model and possibly its context within the true data 
generating process and latent observational process. For example, a prior 
distribution might suppress model configurations that, while not entirely 
impossible, we know stress the accuracy of the modeling approximations.

Once introduced the prior distribution complements the observational model to 
give a _Bayesian model_ defined as a joint distribution over $Y \times \Theta$,
$$
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y, \theta) 
= 
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y \mid \theta) \, \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta).
$$
It is this joint distribution that ultimately defines inferences over the
model configuration space.

Although the observational model and prior model have been introduced 
separately, it is typically the resulting full Bayesian model that facilitates 
model development  Once we separate the model configuration space into 
phenomenological, environmental, and probe parameters, for example, the full 
model can be decomposed into a sequence of conditional distributions that
follows the generative structure of the true data generating process,
$$
\begin{align*}
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y, \theta) 
=& \,
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y, \theta_{\text{phenom}}, \theta_{\text{envir}}, \theta_{\text{probe}}) 
\\
=& \;\;\;
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y \mid \theta_{\text{phenom}}, \theta_{\text{envir}}, \theta_{\text{probe}}) 
\\
& \cdot \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta_{\text{probe}} \mid \theta_{\text{phenom}}, \theta_{\text{envir}}) 
\\
& \cdot \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta_{\text{envir}} \mid \theta_{\text{phenom}}) 
\\
& \cdot \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta_{\text{phenom}}).
\end{align*}
$$
This generative decomposition not only facilitates the development of coherent
yet sophisticated models but also allows different parts of the model to be 
isolated and modeled separately.  This can be hugely beneficial when the 
development is being done by a large team or collaboration and not any one 
individual.

## The Posterior Distribution

Evaluating the full Bayesian model at an explicit observation defines a 
conditional probability distribution over the model configuration space given 
that observation,
$$
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta \mid \tilde{y}) 
\propto
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\tilde{y}, \theta),
$$
or, with the proper normalization,
$$
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta \mid \tilde{y}) 
= 
\frac{ \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\tilde{y}, \theta) }
{ \int_{\Theta} \mathrm{d} \theta \, \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\tilde{y}, \theta) }.
$$
This conditional probability distribution defines the _posterior distribution_ 
that quantifies our probabilistic inferences over the model configuration space.  
The derivation from conditional distribution to joint distribution to transposed
conditional distribution is sometimes called _Bayes' Theorem_, hence the
terminology _Bayesian inference_ to denote the use of the posterior 
distribution for quantifying inferences.

Once evaluated at an explicit observation the joint probability density function 
can also be written as
$$
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\tilde{y}, \theta)
=
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\tilde{y} \mid \theta) \, \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta).
$$
The evaluation of the probability density functions in the observational model 
defines the _likelihood function_,
$$ 
\begin{alignat*}{6}
l_{\tilde{y}} :\; &\Theta& &\rightarrow& \; &\mathbb{R}^{+}&
\\
&\theta& &\mapsto& &\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\tilde{y} \mid \theta)&,
\end{alignat*}
$$
which increases around model configurations that are more consistent with the
observed data.  The posterior density function can then be written in the 
equivalent form
$$
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta \mid \tilde{y}) 
=
\frac{ \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\tilde{y} \mid \theta) }
{ \int_{\Theta} \mathrm{d} \theta \, \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\tilde{y}, \theta) } \cdot
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta).
$$ 
This form demonstrates that the posterior density function, and hence the
posterior distribution itself, concentrates on those model configurations
that are consistent with _both_ our domain expertise, as encoded in the prior 
density function, and the observation, as encoded in the likelihood function.

At the same time this form motivates the interpretation of Bayesian inference as
a procedure for _updating_ the prior distribution into a posterior distribution.
Bayesian inference is a _learning_ process where what we know after the
observation, as encoded in the posterior distribution, is just the combination 
of what we knew before the observation, as encoded in the prior distribution, 
and what we learned from the observation, as encoded in the likelihood function.

```
<br><br>

</center>

Critically, the final shape of the posterior distribution depends on the  
_interaction_ of the prior distribution and the likelihood function for the
observed data.  For example, when the likelihood function concentrates in a 
small neighborhood of the model configuration space it dominates the shape of
the posterior density function,

In other words, the information encoded in the posterior distribution is 
governed almost entirely by what we learn from the observation, and even vague 
priors are sufficient for useful inferences.

The observational model, however, isn't always so well-behaved.  In particular,
our probe might not be sufficiently sensitive to the phenomena of interest at
the scales approximated by the observational model.  In that case the 
observational model is said to be _weakly-identified_ and the likelihood 
function tends to disperses over far regions of the model configuration space
for most, if not all, observations.  In circumstances like these the form of the
posterior distribution is strongly influenced by the form of the prior 
distribution; a careless prior distribution will allo the weak identification of
the likelihood to propagate to the posterior distribution.

In order to compensate for the possibility of poorly-identified likelihood 
functions we need the prior distribution to incorporate a soupçon of domain 
expertise.  At the very least we want the prior distribution to suppress 
extreme, although not entirely impossible, model configurations.

Consequently in order to ensure robust Bayesian inferences we need to develop
the prior model in the context of the observational model, and perhaps even the
context of the latent observational process it approximates.  This is greatly
facilitated by not modeling the two components independently but rather 
developing the full Bayesian model all at once.

## Making Inferences

By construction all of the information deemed relevant to our inferences is 
encoded in the interaction of the full Bayesian model and the observed data, 
and hence manifests in the posterior distribution.  Consequently any inferential 
query we might pose must be answered with valid manipulations of the posterior 
distribution.  In probability theory, however, all valid manipulations formally
reduce to the evaluation of expectation values. 
 
In other words, any question we ask in Bayesian inference is encoded in a 
real-valued function over the model configuration space, 
$g : \Theta \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and the corresponding answer is given by
the posterior expectation value of that function,
$$
\mathbb{E} [ g(\theta) ]
=
\int_{\Theta} \mathrm{d} \theta \, \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta \mid \tilde{y}) \,
g(\theta).
$$

For example we might ask _where_ in the model configuration space our posterior 
concentrates.  We can answer this with posterior means or even posterior 
medians.  Similarly the _breadth_ of this concentration can be quantified by 
posterior standard deviations of even posterior tail quantiles.

The key step in implementing any Bayesian analysis is then the computation of 
the posterior expectation values for whatever functions are deemed relevant to
the analysis.  Here algorithms like Markov chain Monte Carlo prove essential,
consuming joint density functions of the full Bayesian model and returning 
estimates of posterior expectations along with quantifications of the estimator 
errors.

## Making Decisions

What about decision making?  Our ultimate goal, after all, is to make decisions 
given the available information.  Fortunately Bayesian inferences implemented as 
posterior expectations readily inform robust decision making.  

As we saw before, a model-based utility function 
$$ 
\begin{alignat*}{6}
U:\; &A \times \Theta& &\rightarrow& \; &\mathbb{R}^{+}&
\\
&(a, \theta)& &\mapsto& &U(a, \theta)&.
\end{alignat*}
$$
wasn't immediately applicable for making decisions because of the dependence
on a model configuration.  The posterior distribution, however, quantifies which 
of those model configurations are consistent with the available information.  
Consequently we can compute _expected utilities_ as the posterior expectation 
values
$$
\bar{U}(a, \tilde{y}) = 
\mathbb{E}_{ \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta \mid \tilde{y}) } [ U(a, \theta) ]
=
\int_{\Theta} \mathrm{d} \theta \, \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta \mid \tilde{y}) \,
U(a, \theta).
$$
Note the implicit dependence on the observation due to its contribution to the
posterior distribution.

The optimal decision _in the context of the available information_ is then 
given by taking the action that maximizes these expected utilities.  This 
defines the _Bayesian decision making process_
$$
a_{*}(\tilde{y}) = \underset{a \in A}{\text{argmax}} U(a, \tilde{y}).
$$
Mathematically Bayesian decision theory is relatively simple and quite natural,
but it can be a conceptual paradigm shift for many because of its consideration
of the uncertainty inherent in the posterior distribution.  Indeed many common
fallacies arise from ignoring posterior uncertainty or presuming irrelevant 
models.  Going through the steps of developing a Bayesian model and computing 
expected utilities is a powerful way of avoiding common mistakes and 
facilitating more robust decisions.

That said, Bayesian decision theory strives only to make an optimal decision 
in the context of the available information.  There is no guarantee that the 
resulting decision-making process will perform well across the distribution of 
observations that arise from the true data generating process.  For that we 
need to go one step further and _calibrate_ our decision-making process over 
an incidence of reasonable observations.

## Making Predictions

Assuming that the latent observational process is stationary, predictions are
straightforward to make given a particular model configuration.  The predictive
distribution is simply defined by the corresponding data generating process.  

Unfortunately, in Bayesian inference there is no natural way to isolate a single  
model configuration in order to make predictions.  What we can do, however,
is take expectations over _all_ of the model configurations in the observational 
model, with those configurations allocated higher probability more strongly 
influencing the resulting predictive distribution.

Because we have two distributions over the model configuration space available 
in Bayesian inference, we have two natural predictive distributions.

### The Prior Predictive Distribution

One possibility is to average the data generating processes in the observational
model with respect to the prior distribution.  This expectation yields the 
_prior predictive distribution_ whose density is given by
$$
\pi_{S}(y) = \int_{\Theta} \mathrm{d} \theta \, 
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta) \,
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y \mid \theta).
$$

The prior predictive distribution is most strongly influenced by those model 
configurations most consistent with the domain expertise encoded in the prior
distribution.  In other words the prior predictive distribution quantifies our
best understanding of the scope of reasonable observations using only the domain 
expertise that we've introduced.  This allows us to make predictions before
we've made any observations, which is useful when we want to study how our 
inferences and subsequent decision-making processes might play out _before_ we
probe the latent system.

### The Posterior Predictive Distribution

This leaves the posterior distribution as our other option.  The posterior 
expectation over the observational model yields the _posterior predictive 
distribution_ whose density is given by
$$
\pi_{S}(y \mid \tilde{y}) = \int_{\Theta} \mathrm{d} \theta \, 
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(\theta \mid \tilde{y}) \,
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y \mid \theta).
$$

The posterior predictive distribution is influenced by the model configurations
consistent not just with the relevant domain expertise but also the particular
data we've observed.  This makes it ideal for informing predictions about 
future interactions with the latent system that are as precise as possible.  

Comparisons between the posterior predictive distribution and the true data 
generating process also provide a measure of how well our model approximates
the latent system.  Although we can't explicitly form these comparisons in
practice, _estimates_ of these comparisons form the basis of all predictive 
model validation procedures, including information criteria and cross 
validation.

# Bayesian Calibration

Ideally the true data generating process, or at least the best approximation 
to it within our observational model, would fall into a neighborhood of high
posterior probability so that our inferences would be accurate in the context
of the true data generating process.  It would even better if the posterior
distribution converged to a delta function around the best data generating 
process in the observational model as the size of the observation, and hence
the information about the true data generating process it contains, grew to be
infinitely large.  

In general, however, there are no such guarantees in Bayesian inference.  The 
posterior distribution simply follows the information encoded in the model and 
the observation, and without a carefully-designed Bayesian model it can chase 
irrelevant quirks of a given observation away from better data generating
processes.

At the same time it can be difficult to develop principled priors to compensate
for any limitations in the observational model because of the dependence of the
likelihood function on the observed data.  While some observations might yield 
perfectly well-behaved likelihood functions, some observations might conspire to 
yield poorly-identified likelihood functions and some might give likelihood 
functions that strongly concentrate away from the best data generating 
processes.  Without having a sense of what observations, and hence which 
likelihood function behaviors, to expect we are starved for information that can
guide principled model development.

One possible resolution is to repeatedly simulate observations from a known
data generating process and run our analysis to completion, scrutinizing the 
span of resultant likelihood functions, posterior distributions, and 
decisions in the context of the known simulator truth.  The efficacy of this 
approach, however, depends on how well that data generating process approximates 
the relevant features of the _true_ data generating process.  Fortunately in 
Bayesian inference we have a natural data generating process that captures our 
information about the true data generating process before we've examined the 
observed data -- the prior predictive distribution. 

Studying the distribution of posterior behaviors resulting from prior predictive 
observations allows us to identify vulnerabilities in our full Bayesian model 
that limit the accuracy of our inferences.  In particular, we can quantify if 
our model is good enough to ask the inferential questions, or inform the 
decisions, required of a given analysis.  More formally we push the Bayesian 
joint distribution, $\pi_{\mathcal{S}} (y, \theta)$ through the composite 
utility function,  $U(a(y), \theta)$, to produce a distribution of possible
outcomes that we can compare to our needs.  We can even use the distribution of 
posteriors to calibrate the accuracy of our Bayesian computational methods in a 
procedure known as _simulation-based calibration_.

That said, the conclusions we draw from these calibrations will be limited by 
the quality of the initial Bayesian model that gives rise to the prior 
predictive distribution that we employ.  If we are not confident that our 
observational model accurately approximates the true data generating process
or that our prior model encodes reasonable domain expertise, in particular 
sufficient domain expertise to regularize any misbehavior of plausible
likelihood functions, then of what use are these calibrations?  In practice 
these calibrations serve as a way of _bootstrapping_ model development.  
Starting with an initial crude model we can use these calibrations to identify 
the limitations of that model and inform improvements such as more sophisticated 
observational models, more precise domain expertise, or even more robust methods 
for computing expectations.  This information is critical to a _principled 
Bayesian workflow_ for model development.

At the same time the Bayesian model used for constructing the calibrating 
prior predictive distribution need not be the same Bayesian model we use in our
posterior analysis.  We could, for example, use a more sophisticated, and more
expensive, model to calibrate a cruder approximation that we aim to employ in
a given application.  Indeed this asymmetry mirrors practice common in the 
sciences.

# Conclusion

Bayesian inference is a versatile methodology for fusing information from 
observations and domain expertise into coherent inferences and decision-making
processes.  The probabilistic foundations of the methodology ensure that the 
mechanisms for evaluating, analyzing, and criticizing inferences are all 
implemented by the natural operations in probability theory.  

Conceptually this makes Bayesian computation particularly well-suited to 
automation once a full Bayesian model has been specified.  In practice automated
computation can't quite be realized, but with the careful utilization of modern 
tools we can get impressively close.  At the same time, carefully-designed 
probabilistic programming languages provide the means for practitioners to 
specify the broad extent of models that arise in applications.  

Together probabilistic programming and state-of-the-art Bayesian computational
methods provide a complete platform for implementing Bayesian inference in 
practice.  In particular, their combination is the basis for Stan.

# Appendix A.1: Frequentist Inference {-}

Bayesian inference is just one approach to quantifying consistency between data
generating processes in the observational model and observed data.  The more
orthodox approach is _frequentist_ inference which eschews probabilities for 
binary quantifications of consistency.

The fundamental difference between Bayesian and frequentist methods is that the
latter makes the strong philosophical assumption that probability theory can
be applied to _only_ events that can be repeated infinitely often.  In that way
probabilities can be _defined_ as the long run frequencies of these events, and
because all observers would encounter the same frequencies these probabilities 
would be physical and independent of the observer.  

Unfortunately this definition quickly runs into technical difficulties.  Not
only can we not actually realize the infinite, perfect replications needed to 
define the limiting frequencies in practice, this infinite limit is subtle and 
not always so well-defined.  Consequently formal frequentist inference pulls a 
mild bait and switch -- the frequency definition of probabilities is replaced 
with Kolmogorov's axioms with the restricted applicability to hypothetically
repeatable events.

Consequently if we presume that the circumstances of an observation can be 
exactly replicated then we can still use probability theory to describe the 
distribution of possible observations, and motivate the same observational model
that have previously considered.  At the same time we can no longer apply 
probability theory to quantify information about the model configuration space 
as well.

We are then left with binary quantifications of consistency; model 
configurations are either consistent with the observation or they're not. An 
immediate shortcoming of such binary quantifications is that they're much less 
informative than posterior distributions, as a probability distribution can 
encode far more information than a step function.  A more serious weakness is 
that once a model configuration is deemed inconsistent it can no longer inform 
decisions.  An overaggressive quantification can be lead astray by irrelevant 
features of an observation and end up throwing away model configurations that
well approximate the true data generating process, if not the true data 
generating process itself.

To compensate for this frailty the frequentist approach treats inference as a 
decision-making process and carefully calibrates those decisions to ensure that 
the binary quantifications are well-behaved _on average_.  

More formally, binary quantifications of consistency are defined by _estimators_
that deterministically map observations into some binary quantifications of the 
model configuration space.  If we treat the possible quantifications as actions, 
$a$, then an estimator defines a decision-making processes, a(\tilde{y})$, that
we can then calibrate with a model-based utility function, $U(a, \theta)$.

If we presume that some $\theta$ is the true model configuration then we can use 
the corresponding data generating process to define the expected utility of a 
given estimator,
$$
\bar{U}(\theta) = \int_{Y} \mathrm{d} y \, \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y ; \theta) \,
U(a(y), \theta).
$$
Because of the foundational assumptions of the frequentist perspective we are 
limited in how we can take into account the remaining dependence on the model 
configuration.  Just about the only thing that we can do is report the
_worst case utility_,
$$
U^{*} = \underset{\theta \in \Theta}{\text{argmin}} \bar{U}(\theta).
$$
In that way we can calibrate the worst case behavior of the estimator, at 
least provided that the true data generating process is contained within the 
observational model.

For example, we might use _point estimator_ that maps observations into single 
model configurations,
$$ 
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\hat{\theta}:\; &Y& &\rightarrow& \; &\Theta&
\\
&y& &\mapsto& &\hat{\theta}(y)&.
\end{alignat*}
$$
In that case we might apply a utility function that considers the distance 
between the point estimate and the presumed true model configuration,
$$ 
\begin{alignat*}{6}
U:\; &Y \times \Theta& &\rightarrow& \; &-\mathbb{R}^{+}&
\\
&(y, \theta)& &\mapsto& &\mid -\hat{\theta}(y) - \theta \mid^{2}&.
\end{alignat*}
$$
The more accurate and precise our point estimator is the smaller the distance
will be and the more utility the estimator will be assigned.  For each model 
configuration we'd then compute the expected utility 
$$
\bar{U}(\theta) = \int_{Y} \mathrm{d} y \, \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y ; \theta) \,
\mid \hat{\theta}(y) - \theta \mid^{2}.
$$
and then summarize the expected performance of the point estimator with the
worst case utility.  

Alternatively we might consider _confidence sets_ that map observations into 
entire sets of model configurations, 
$$ 
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\widehat{\Delta \theta}:\; &Y& &\rightarrow& \; &\mathcal{T}&
\\
&y& &\mapsto& &\widehat{\Delta \theta}(y)&,
\end{alignat*}
$$
where $\mathcal{T}$ is an appropriate $\sigma$-algebra over the model 
configuration space.  Here we might employ a utility function that considers 
whether or not the estimated set includes the presumed true model configuration,
$$ 
\begin{alignat*}{6}
U:\; &Y \times \Theta& &\rightarrow& \; &\{0, 1\}&
\\
&(y, \theta)& &\mapsto& &\mathbb{I}[ \theta \in \widehat{\Delta \theta}(y) ]&.
\end{alignat*}
$$
The expected utility for a given model configuration is then the probability
of containment, or _coverage_,
$$
\begin{align*}
\bar{U}(\theta) 
&= 
\int_{Y} \mathrm{d} y \, \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y ; \theta) \,
\mathbb{I} [ \theta \in \widehat{\Delta \theta}(y) ]
\\
&= \mathbb{P} [ \theta \in \widehat{\Delta \theta}(y) ].
\end{align*}
$$
In other words, our confidence set is playing [ring toss around the presumed
truth](https://twitter.com/epiellie/status/1073385427317465089) and we want to 
know how often we score a ringer.  The final calibration of a confidence set is 
then the smallest coverage across all possible model configurations,
$$
U^{*} = \underset{\theta \in \Theta}{\text{argmin}} 
\mathbb{P} [ \theta \in \widehat{\Delta \theta}(y) ].
$$

Importantly, frequentist inference does not define any particular inferential 
procedure but rather a definite procedure for calibrating estimators.  In order 
to develop a frequentist analysis we need to specify not just our observational 
model but also an estimator and its associated utility function and then carry 
out the worst case utility analysis.

That worst case analysis is extremely conservative.  An estimator might be 
well-behaved for most reasonable model configurations, but its worst case 
behavior can be dominated by the behavior of extreme, but not impossible, model 
configurations.  That said, if we can engineer an estimator with an acceptable
worst case loss then we have confidence of that its behavior will be robust, at
least within the context of the assumptions inherent in the observational model.

In practice, however, the worst case utility is typically infeasible to compute 
for nontrivial models, even with simple estimators.  At the same time computing 
the worst case utility of more sophisticated estimators can be infeasible even 
for simple models.  Consequently most frequentist results are limited to careful 
pairings of models, estimators, and utility functions that admit convenient 
calculations.  Because these are the only available results, they are often 
forced into applications where the assumed observational model is a poor 
approximation to the system being analyzed and the assumed estimator is 
irrelevant to the overall inferential goals of the analysis.  This is why 
frequentist methods are so often presented as black boxes that consume data and 
excrete inferences without any consideration of the implicit assumptions.  

That said, there is a particular circumstance where such general results can be 
applicable to many systems: the magical land of asymptotia.

# Appendix A.2: Asymptotics {-}

Consider an observation comprised of many identical and independently generated
components, $y = \{ y_{1}, \ldots, y_{N} \}$ with the total observation space 
defined as the product of each component observation space, 
$\times_{n = 1}^{N} Y$.

As the number of these components, $N$, grows our observation should assimilate
more information and eventually only those model configurations that closely 
approximate the true data generating process should have any chance of being 
estimated as consistent with the observation.  In other words, the likelihood
function should concentrate around the true data generating process.

At the same time, when we consider an observation with an increasing number of 
components the idiosyncratic properties of any particular component observation
should average out.  How the likelihood function concentrates around the true
data generating process should largely be irrelevant of the particular details
of any given observation.

These intuitions are formalized in the theory of _asymptotics_.  Here we assume
that the likelihood function for any observation is smooth and then consider the 
_maximum likelihood estimator_,
$$
\theta_{\text{ML}}(y) =  
\underset{\theta \in \Theta}{\text{argmin}}
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y ; \theta).
$$
If the observational model contains the true data generating process, 
$\pi^{*}(y) = \pi(y ; \theta^{*})$ for some true model configuration 
$\theta^{*}$, then under some technical conditions the distribution of maximum 
likelihood estimates converges towards $\theta^{*}$ as the number of component 
observations increases.  In particular, for sufficiently large $N$ the maximum 
likelihood estimator approximately follows a Gaussian distribution,
$$
J(\theta_{\text{ML}}(y)) \cdot (\theta_{\text{ML}}(y) - \theta^{*}) \sim 
\mathcal{N}(0, 1),
$$
where $J$ is the _Fisher information matrix_ which evaluates the expectation 
value of the Hessian of the log likelihood function,
$$
J_{ij}(\theta) = \int_{Y} \mathrm{d} y \, 
\pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y ; \theta)
\frac{ \partial^{2} }{ \partial \theta_{i} \partial \theta_{j} } 
\log \pi_{\mathcal{S}}(y ; \theta).
$$

Once this asymptotic behavior takes hold the expected utility becomes a Gaussian
integral which will be straightforward to compute, if not outright analytic, for
many utility functions.  Moreover, because the distribution for the maximum
likelihood estimator depends only on the true model configuration we don't have
to worry about figuring out a worst case expected utility, as all of the 
expected utilities will be the same.

Consequently in this asymptotic limit we can construct point estimators and 
confidence sets with known calibrations regardless of the specifics of the 
observational model.  To implement them in practice all we have to do is compute
a straightforward maximization of the likelihood function.  If we're being good
we'd also verify that the observation has enough independent components for the
asymptotic limit to be a reasonable approximation.

Verifying for what $N$ a given observational model is well approximated by
asymptotic behavior, however, is no trivial task.  Simpler models will converge
to the asymptotic limit faster and hence be well approximated with smaller $N$,
while more complex models will typically require larger $N$.  Working out the
exact details of this convergence, however, requires serious mathematical tools.

Perhaps more importantly, the assumption that the observational model contains
the true data generating process can obstruct the applicability of the 
asymptotic limit altogether.  Recall that observational models are themselves 
often crude approximations to the true data generating process.  For small $N$
the observation will be only weakly informative and we can't resolve the system 
well enough to notice the approximation.  As we collect more components and 
$N$ increases, however, our observations become informative enough that we can
resolve the limitations of the observational model.  In other words, as we try
to escape to the asymptotic limit the assumption that the observational model 
contains the true data generating process become harder and harder to justify.

Consider, for example, an observational model where we ignore any heterogeneity 
in the processes that generate each component observation so that we need only a 
few parameters homogenous to all the components.  For sufficiently many 
components the asymptotic limit will well-approximate the homogenous 
observational model.  In that limit, however, our inferences for the homogenous
parameters become precise enough that we start to resolve the heterogeneity that 
we ignored.  Even though the homogenous observational model converges to the 
asymptotic limit, it _diverges_ from the true data generating process and the 
limit becomes largely irrelevant.

When the observational model is an approximation the ultimate utility of the 
asymptotic limit depends on the existence of an intermediate $N$ for which the 
observational model converges close enough to the asymptotic limit without 
diverging too far from the true data generating process.  Demonstrating that
such an $N$ exists, and then identifying it if it does, in a particular 
application is an extremely challenging task.

Still, frequentist asymptotics have become the norm in many applied fields
because of the ease of their implementation, and the ease with which the 
underlying assumptions can be ignored.  Indeed frequentist inference has become 
so tightly bound to the asymptotic limit in much of the academic literature it 
becomes the basis for unfounded comparisons to Bayesian methods.

A common refrain is that frequentist methods are much less computationally 
demanding than Bayesian methods.  This comparison, however, is not between the 
general application of the two methodologies but rather between the application
of frequentist methods in the asymptotic limit and the general application of 
Bayesian methods _without_ the luxury of that limit.  A single optimization 
through the model configuration space is undoubtable less computationally 
demanding than the survey of the model configuration space needed to accurately 
approximate posterior expectation values, but this isn't a balanced comparison.

The asymptotic limit drastically simplifies the structure of the observational 
model, reducing the burden of _both_ frequentist and Bayesian computation.  In
the asymptotic limit we no longer need to rely on general Bayesian tools for 
computing posterior expectations and can instead utilize approximate algorithms 
that exploit the asymptotic structure. If the limit well approximates the 
observational model in a given application then any fair comparison has to allow 
both methodologies to take advantage in which case the computational burden 
becomes practically equivalent.

On the other hand, if the asymptotic limit poorly approximates the observational
model then we have to rely the general frequentist and Bayesian methodologies.
Here we can no longer rely on the asymptotic calibration of maximum likelihood 
estimators and instead have to engineer a bespoke estimator and go through the 
costly calibration process in its entirety.  In comparison, building and 
calibrating a Bayesian model is often much less computationally demanding.
